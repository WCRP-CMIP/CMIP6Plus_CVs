I just wanted to drop this in here in case anyone else had this problem. (Iâ€™m using the default rpi wifi card and Ethernet) one day I noticed my speeds had gotten extremely slow (like 0.5 Mbps) and so I checked out the Wireless mode in the hotspot section. The wireless mode was set to 802.11g or something along those lines. I decided to try changing it to 802.11n and boom I was getting 20 Mbps again

You can get even faster throughput with 802.11ac 5GHz wireless. Speeds in the range of 100 Mbps are possible with the RPi's 3b+/4's onboard chipset. Check out this FAQ for more info.
